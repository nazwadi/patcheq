- A spell research table is now available in the Plane of Knowledge near the Rasumus clan.


*** Quests And Events ***

- Hunter of The Plane of Valor - The rare creature previously named 'a Lumbering Beast' is now named 'an Ungainly Beast' to better differentiate it from the non-rare creatures that were also named 'a Lumbering Beast'.

- Access to Asylum of Anguish (Quest) - A Shrewd Dragorn no longer has a placeholder and is now guaranteed to spawn (in new locations) in all versions of the Dranik's Hollows instances. He now carries six signets but will not respawn in the same instance.

*** Spells ***

- Illusion Benefit buffs now persist through death.
- Fixed a bug that caused the healing effects of lifetap spells to expend counters on buffs that fade after being hit by detrimental spells.
- Berserker - Corrected an issue that prevented several abilities (the Volley line and Dichotomic Rage) from properly checking for the reagent they were flagged to require.

- Warrior - Increased the cost of Harmonious Expanse. Reduced the number of counters on Harmonious Expanse Effect to 40. Greatly reduced the hate added by Expansive Disharmony.
- Warrior - Increased the cost of Harmonious Precision. Reduced the number of counters on Harmonious Precision Effect to 40. Greatly reduced the hate added and damage done by Precise Disharmony. Greatly reduced the healing done by Harmonious Vigor.

- - Changed Frenzied Kicks to reduce the reuse timer of the Kick skill.
