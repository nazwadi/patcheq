- Cactiikii (Raid) - The atrocious cacti will now only spawn one add at a time instead of four.
- Kerafyrm the Awakened (Raid) - Kerafyrm can no longer be slain, which will ensure that the raid will complete successfully when he is reduced below 5% health.
- Disable the Recycler (Fortress Mechanotus Task) - Added safety logic to despawn the event if it has not been completed for 15 minutes, which should prevent it from getting into a bad state for days.
- Marton Sayer in Qeynos Hills will now reward adventurers with a version of the Gnoll Slayer that does not include Bane Damage before Shadows of Luclin is active.

Game Update Notes: August 19, 2020
------------------------------

*** Highlights ***

- Necromancer - The critical DoT focus effects on the Necromancer epic 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 will now begin to decay in effectiveness when casting spells above level 80.
- Fixed an issue where the task window would sometimes display 'left over' task steps from a different task.


*** Items ***

- Unequipping items whose stats are increased when wearing Power Sources will now immediately remove the invisible augments that provide these stat bonuses.
- - This corrects several issues that indicated that the item can not be modified until all augments are removed.

- Removed heirloom from tradeable items since it's redundant.
- Necromancer - The critical DoT focus effects on the Necromancer epic 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 will now begin to decay in effectiveness when casting spells above level 80.


*** Tradeskills ***

- Corrected the spelling of Rallos Zek Devotee's Defense and Rallos Zek Acolyte's Defense to be consistent with other things with defense in the name.
- Corrected the spelling of crystallized in several recipes.


*** Quests & Events ***

- The Conflagration Generals - Added a zone-wide message when a whorling wildfire is hit with the proper spell. The message will indicate who cast what spell and what the special damage is.
- Earning One's Place - Fixed the faction requirement to now work properly. You must be "threateningly" to the Servants of Esianti to get the task.
- Grummus Event (Plane of Health) - Fixed an issue that was preventing the grumlings from "exploding" when they die. They will now cast Explosive Pus as expected when they die.

- Fixed a client crash when moving or deleting an item in the middle of casting free target spells.
- Updated the message when scribing ToV spells to be more informative.

- Corrected an issue that periodically caused the spell bar to become locked out, either after activating an item or while casting spells with the highest ranks of the Bard AA ability Quick Time active.
- Cleric - The Crippling Glare effects from the Shining Rampart line will no longer create a debuff on the target. Reduced the chance to proc slightly (from a base of 10ppm to 9ppm) and changed the heal from a recourse to a trigger cast so that it will now be able to heal you even if the stun can not land.
- Necromancer - The Curse of Mortality line of spells no longer stacks with itself. Increased the damage dealt and mana cost.
- Necromancer - The Swift Deconstruction line of spells no longer stacks with itself or with the Curse of Mortality line. It now deals the same amount of damage as the equivalent spell from the Curse of Mortality line, with the same efficiency. Removed the shared spell timer from the line. This spell line will no longer deal different damage to different targets. Increased the resist modifier so it lands more reliably.


*** AA ***

- Fixed an incorrectly referenced level range in the spell description for the max rank Enchanter Gracious Gift of Mana proc.
- Added a spell description to Enchanter Reactive Rune IV through XIII and standardized the AA description at all ranks.
- Shaman/Magician Wind of Malaise ranks 2, 3, 10, and 11 now have the same expansion and level requirements as the ranks of Malaise that unlock them.
- Magician Companion's Fury ranks 110, 111, 112, 133, 134, 135, and 136 now require expansions that match their level requirements.

- Geomar Hapera in Paineel now correctly offers Parcel and Recovery services.

- Fixed an issue where the task window would sometimes display 'left over' task steps from a different task.
- Fixed an issue that was causing erratic behavior for a raid's delegated main assists, NPC markers, and master looter after a change in raid leadership. This should fix the problem where /assist main or /assist raid would stop working as expected.
- Fixed an issue that would cause an ornament to stick to an item if it had a reward that was claimed while the ornament was in an item. Instead, you will be unable to claim the reward until the ornament has been removed. Players with a stuck ornament will need to use an Ornamentation Stripping Tool to remove the ghost ornament from their item.
- Moved DoT damage taken by your character from the DoTs (Others) filter to the DoTs (Yours) filter.
- Removed voice chat integration from the game.

*** Quests & Events ***

- Shared tasks will now accurately display a max duration of 24 hours rather than listing unlimited time remaining.
- Franklin Teek remembered that there is no such thing as "highlor" kobolds in Norrath, and has realized that he meant "highland" kobolds. He apologizes to all adventurers who he confused.

- Fixed an issue that caused the 21st Anniversary Overseer Quest "I Guess This is Growing Up" to remain available after the event had ended.

- You can now start or complete conversion quests when you have hit the active or completed quest caps and they continue to not count towards these caps.
- The DBC costs to recover an incapacitated Agent have been rebalanced. The minimum cost to recover an Agent has slightly increased while the cost to recover an Agent with a multi-day incapacitation has decreased significantly.
- Modified how Available Agents are sorted in the Quests tab for non-conversion quests. They are now sorted by the total number of matching traits and jobs, then by job ranks, rarity, and finally name. This change will usually result in sorting Agents with the highest potential contribution ahead of the pack.
- - Conversion Quests now sort by the total number of idle duplicates in descending order, then by name.
- Optional quest party slots now display their required job rank.
- Agents who offer no benefit to a quest no longer appear in the Available Agents list in the Quests tab.

*** Progression Servers ***

- Players may server transfer between progression servers that are in the same or later expansion and within the same or a less restricted ruleset. True box is more restrictive than servers without it. Free trade (Firiona Vie ruleset) is less restrictive than servers without it. Voting unlock servers are more restrictive than servers without voting. This means:
- - Characters on any progression server may transfer to live servers.
- - Characters on Aradune, Agnarr, Coirnav, and Mangler may transfer to Phinigel.
- - Characters on Aradune and Mangler may transfer to Selo.
- - Characters on Aradune may transfer to Mangler or Rizlona.


*** Miscellaneous ***

- When starting a new shared task or dynamic zone, players in a group or raid will be added in order by what group they are in from 1 to 12 in the raid window, followed by ungrouped players. The raid leader will always be added first. This is to alleviate the need to remove and reinvite additional players if there isn't room for them in the instance. Within a single group, the order players are added to the instance is not necessarily what is displayed in the raid window.
- On new characters, autosplit will now be enabled by default.


*** UI ***

- Corrected an issue that would prevent the reward selection window from displaying your pending rewards.
- Fixed an issue where /grouproles could cause your client to crash.

- Corrected an issue where some characters who are in a fellowship were not always appearing in their fellowship.
- The /report command now gives you the option to open a Customer Service ticket in a browser, as reports will not be investigated without a corresponding ticket. Updated the help text for report to be more accurate. This command reports the first 20 visible lines of text in each open chat window, starting with the main chat window. /report can now be used once every minute instead of once each time your character zones.
- Added the /usetarget command which will left click a targeted player or right click a targeted NPC to help facilitate interactions in crowded areas.
