------------------------------

*** Highlights ***

- EverQuest's 25th expansion, The Burning Lands, is now live!
- Added the Faction Window to allow the quick viewing of your current faction standings. See the UI section below for details.
- Items will now display their lore text to players at level 50 and higher.


*** The Burning Lands ***

- The longstanding peace between the jann is over, and war has broken out between the djinn from the Plane of Air and the efreeti from the Plane of Fire! What has sparked this dispute and who will emerge victorious? Will you survive the Trials of Smoke and help end this conflict?
- Many items found in The Burning Lands will have a new stat called Luck. See the item section below for details.
- Players with The Burning Lands will have two new shared bank slots available.


*** Items ***

- Items will now display their lore text to players at level 50 and higher.
- Added a new stat, Luck, to many items found in The Burning Lands.
- - Luck can be found on new items and the amount of luck you have will influence the outcome of many skills, abilities, and spells. You can see the luck on items by inspecting them. Items with a percentage symbol next to their luck total can have their luck increased via item fusion (hover over the percentage for more information).
- - Many items with luck can utilize the Item Fusion Window to improve that item's luck stat. At the cost of one Crystallized Luck, this window allows you to fuse two items together (the base item and the component) to increase the luck on the base item. Fusing two items will result in the luck on the base item being increased and the component item will be destroyed. After fusing two items together, the base item will receive the higher luck of the two, plus one. For example, fusing a base item with 2 luck and a component at 4 luck will result in the base item having 5 luck.
- - Crystallized Luck can be purchased from Noble Exchange Merchants for platinum, from Loyalty Vendors, or from the Marketplace.
- Corrected an issue where players could equip multiple lore equipped items using bandolier.
- Upgraded the effect of Threads of Potential and Boon of the Soother.


*** Tradeskills ***

- Doing tradeskill combines that don't require a skill will no longer proc unrelated skills or abilities.
- Changed the name of two alchemy recipes to match the name of their products (Ward of Retribution, Wasp Swarm).


*** Spells ***

- Cleaned up messaging when an aura spell fails to hit a pet or mercenary due to being in a different environment type (such as water or lava) than the caster.
- Aura spells that kill their targets in one tick now properly report the death.
- Melody now skips to the next song if a recast timer hasn't elapsed, instead of interrupting the melody.
- Modern generic proc spells on items will no longer cause odd skill increases.
- Bard - Moved the Dirge of the Darkvine line of songs from Statistic Buffs -> Armor Class to Statistic Buffs -> Shielding since it adds shielding and not armor class. Extended the base duration to one minute as the line was originally intended to function.


*** NPCs ***

- Fixed the bug that was causing Heratius Grolden in Tenebrous Mountains to spawn when killing the placeholder trigger NPCs instead of the rare trigger NPCs.


*** Progression Servers ***

- The Agent of Change will not appear in Cazic-Thule until Planes of Power has unlocked on the server.


*** Miscellaneous ***

- Corrected an issue where an issue with one of your characters could stop you from logging into your account altogether.


*** UI ***

- Added a Faction Window that allows you to check your reaction and standing with every group in EverQuest.
- - This new window can be accessed by clicking the EQ Button and selecting Character -> Faction Standings or by typing /faction.
- - Hovering over a faction name or reaction entry will display your current reaction value with a group as well as the number of points needed to reach the next reaction rank.
- - Hovering over the standing progress bar will display your current standing (how much you have done to help or hurt this group) as well as the minimum and maximum possible standing with the group.
- Items located in your Item Overflow will now be listed in the Find Item Window.
- Added Rampage, Wild Rampage, and Flurry tags messages to the full round of melee attacks. Removed the single line messages that indicated something flurried or rampaged.
- Consolidated many chat messages that were duplicates of melee and non melee hits, including: Flurry, Finishing/Crippling Blow, Assassinate, Deadly Strike, Slay Undead, Headshot, and critical spells. These messages no longer have a separate line of text, instead they end with an indication of the special attack type in parenthesis.
- Added an indicator for twincasted and critical damage over time spells.
- Corrected an issue where players could not make a hotkey for Remove Traps.
- Using the AA ability 'Buy All' button with purchase confirmations enabled will now display the number of ranks and total cost of the purchase. This applies to both player and mercenary AA purchases.
- Corrected an issue where a new group wouldn't display the role of a master looter for the leader in the group window.
