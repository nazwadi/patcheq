*** Tradeskills ***

- Changed the dodge effect granted by Enchanted Sugar Cakes to match other effects from the era.


*** Miscellaneous ***

- A number of changes have been made to the Taunt skill:
- - Corrected a longstanding bug with pet taunt which resulted in pets having a 0% chance to successfully taunt their target.
- - Corrected a bug that could result in Warriors failing to taunt their target if the taunt button was used too rapidly.
- - Increased the overall success rate of taunt, most notably reducing the rate that taunt will fail against higher level targets.

- - Added a 2% chance for a successful taunt to result in 10% more hatred than the most hated target.

- - Added messaging for both player and pet taunt to more clearly inform the user to what degree they or their pet succeeded or failed.
- Players, pets, and mercenaries will no longer emit idle sound effects. This should reduce the cacophony caused by a number of relatively boisterous illusions.
- The music that plays when you die will no longer loop while you are in hover mode.
- Many Velious zones will spin up new instanced versions when they are populated by enough adventurers.
- Name changes that fail will now include more details about why they failed.

- Plane of Hate: Revisited and Plane of Fear: Revisited - These zones will now allow you to place and teleport to guild banners as well as place but not teleport to fellowship campfires.
- Plane of Hate: Revisited - Adjusted the aggro-pathing in an effort to alleviate the likelihood that denizens of the plane will opt to use rooftops to reach their target.


*** UI ***

- When using advanced looting and right clicking on a corpse you have access to, it will now open the advanced loot window.
- Auto crouch is now disabled by default.

- Fixed an issue in the claim window which caused it to lock up when attempting to claim a lore item that you already owned.
- Fixed an item preview issue for Drakkin models so that it now correctly matches the color and tattoo settings of the player character.
- Changed the auto-attack on assist setting so that it persists per character instead of per client. New and existing characters will have this toggled on by default. Please use the command /assist on or /assist off to toggle this setting for each individual character going forward.


- Changed -
EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml


*** Previously Updated ***

- High Bokon Boromas (Raid) - High Bokon Boromas will no longer lock his health immediately on engage.
- Anashti Sul, Enslaver of Souls (Raid and Group) - Removed the corpse cleanup functionality from these events in order to prevent situations where Anashti Sul's corpse could not be looted.

*** Highlights ***

- Numerous AAs have had their effects consolidated into their main lines.
- We’ve simplified many item mods so that they’re now calculated using Heroic Stats.


*** Items ***

- The following item mods have been converted to 'Heroic Mods' and will now be calculated as a function of a player's total Heroic Statistics:
- - Accuracy: 4 points per point of Heroic Dexterity up to 150 accuracy.
- - Avoidance: 3 points per point of Heroic Agility up to 100 avoidance.
- - Combat Effects: 3 points per point of Heroic Dexterity up to 100 combat effects.
- - Damage Shield: 1 point per point of Heroic Strength up to 35 points of damage shield.
- - Damage Shield Mitigation: 1 point per point of Heroic Strength up to 25 points of damage shield mitigation.
- - DoT Shielding: 1% per point of Heroic Wisdom or Heroic Intelligence (whichever total is higher) up to 35% DoT Shielding.
- - Shielding: 1% per point of Heroic Stamina up to 35% Shielding.
- - Spell Shielding: 1% per point of Heroic Wisdom or Heroic Intelligence (whichever total is higher) up to 35% Spell Shielding.
- - Strikethrough: 1% per point of Heroic Agility up to 35% Strikethrough.
- - Stun Resist: 1% per point of Heroic Stamina up to 35% Stun Resist.
- The caps on Heroic Mods have been extended once the player's corresponding Heroic Statistic reaches 400 points. The increased caps and the amount of Heroic Statistics required to increase Heroic Mods beyond their initial caps can be viewed as tooltips in the Stats page of the inventory window.
- Removed the restriction that required Secrets of Faydwer to be unlocked on the server and owned by the player in order to utilize the effects of Heroic Statistics.
- Coinciding with the conversion of numerous 'Item Mods' to 'Heroic Mods', all items that previously had mod values that are now 'Heroic Mods' have had their values converted into Heroic Statistics. If the existing Heroic Statistic on an item was already greater than the conversion value, then it has been left unchanged. Due to the fact that each Heroic Statistic (besides Heroic Charisma) now impacts two Heroic Mods, the conversion ratio has been scaled as follows:
- - Accuracy: 1-3 points is now 1 Heroic Dexterity, 4+ points is now 1 + total/8 rounded up.
- - Avoidance: 1-2 points is now 1 Heroic Agility, 3+ points is now 1 + total/6 rounded up.
- - Combat Effects: 1-2 points is now 1 Heroic Dexterity, 3+ points is now 1 + total/6 rounded up.
- - Damage Shield: 1-3 points is now 1 Heroic Strength, 4+ points is now 3 + total/2 rounded up.
- - Damage Shield Mitigation: 1-3 points is now 1 Heroic Strength, 4+ points is now 3 + total/2 rounded up.
- - DoT Shielding: 1-3 points is now 1 Heroic Intelligence and/or Heroic Wisdom, 4+ points is now 3 + total/2 rounded up.
- - Shielding: 1-3 points is now 1 Heroic Stamina, 4+ points is now 3 + total/2 rounded up.
- - Spell Shielding: 1-3 points is now 1 Heroic Intelligence and/or Heroic Wisdom, 4+ points is now 3 + total/2 rounded up.
- - Strikethrough: 1-3 points is now 1 Heroic Agility, 4+ points is now 3 + total/2 rounded up.
- - Stun Resist: 1-3 points is now 1 Heroic Stamina, 4+ points is now 3 + total/2 rounded up.
- Bottles of Replenishment and Spirit can no longer be dispelled.
- Frozen Orb of the Fabled King can now cycle through its 5 variations using the item conversion button.
- Stone of the Crystal Circle can now cycle through its 3 variations using the item conversion button.
- The stats on Jenniy's Two-ton Cuirass will again give you something you can hold on to.
- The spell descriptions for Seething Fury on the Rogue epic, Ragebringer, and Rage of Tallon on the Warrior epic, Blade of Tactics, are now correct. The attack and haste components of the buffs on these epics were moved to the items' stats long ago.


*** Quests & Events ***

- Velishan (Raid) - Velishan will now correctly cast the AE Frozen Limbs periodically while in ice form.
- Velishan (Raid) - Velishan's Targeted AE while in ice form, Frost Shock, now has a much lower impact radius.
- Sleeper's Tomb - This will now automatically switch to the post-awakened version after Kerafyrm has been awakened instead of requiring developer intervention.
- Brew Day - Corrected a scheduling error that turned Brew Day into Brew Year.


*** Spells ***

- Enchanter - The Mind Shatter line will now return mana at a lower rate. It will still return more mana than it did before damage was increased.
- Enchanter - Added hate modifiers to the Mind Shatter, Strangle, and Baffling Constriction lines so they generate less hate when they land.
- Ranger - Increased damage and efficiency of the Locust Swarm line of DoTs, but one character will no longer be able to stack multiple spells from the same line on the same target.
- Ranger - Added a negative hate modifier to the Locust Swarm line of DoTs so it will not generate as much extra hatred as the increased damage would otherwise cause.
- Ranger - Renamed Cloud of Wasps to Wasp Swarm and Horde of Hornets to Hornet Swarm so that those two spell names now fit better in their line.


*** NPC ***
